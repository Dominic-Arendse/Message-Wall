# Message Wall
A web application built with Laravel (5.6) allowing users to share messages, on a public wall (page), to be seen by the rest of the world.

**Setup Your Environment**

This project is built with Laravel (5.6) and thus uses Composer to manage dependencies.
All that is required for you to get your environment up and running is as follows:
1.  Clone the repository into a location of your choice.
2.  Run `composer install`.

**Building/Compiling The Project**

There consists various ways to setup this application (i.e. actual web server setup), but to keep things simple all that is required to build this application is to run `php artisan serve`.

Once the command has been executed successfully, a URL will be generated that you can visit (i.e. `Laravel development server started: <http://127.0.0.1:8000>`) to see the application in action.
